But he was never fully satisfied. One day, however, he was offered a bowl of rice from a young girl and he accepted it. In that moment, he realised that physical austerities were not the means to achieve liberation. From then on, he encouraged people to follow a path of balance rather than extremism. He called this The Middle Way. <br> That night Siddhartha sat under the Bodhi tree, and meditated until dawn. He purified his mind of all defilements and attained enlightenment at the age of thirty-five, thus earning the title Buddha, or &#8220;Enlightened One&#8220;. For the remainder of his eighty years, the Buddha preached the Dharma in an effort to help other sentient beings reach enlightenment.",

Jayavarman\'s Buddhism seems to have been a revised version of the Brahmanical religion which previous Khmer kings had exploited to deify their own persons. The central deity in Jayavarman\'s religion was Lokeshvara, &#8220;Lord of the Worlds&#8220;, and rebuilding Angkor Thom on a stupendously grand scale, the king created a &#8220;Buddhist&#8220; city as a monument to Lokeshvara, who was an aspect of Jayavarman\'s divine self.
